# Projector
Source-Code for Rails 6 tutorial in Serbian language, created on [Krstarica forum](https://forum.krstarica.com)  
Purpose of this project is to introduce Rails to begginers in my country, and to create Freelance & Crowdfunding Open-Source platform

## Application:

 - Users (name, email, password)
 - Projects (name, description, money, balance, active)
 - Categories (name, description)
 
Users can register and create new projects. Each project will have field for money (how much is needed for project), and balance (how much is gathered). Projects will be in categories, and each project will get Bitcoin address for donations. After I finish this tutorial, I will do another 'how to deploy rails app to heroku', while creating demo for Projector.
